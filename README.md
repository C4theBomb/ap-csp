# AP CSP Lessons (C4 Patino)

My name is C4 Patino, and I am a second-year coding student at Collegiate School of Medicine and Bioscience. I am enrolled in AP CSP, where we are learning the fundamentals of programming with Scratch and Python. I also have basic experience with languages like Java, PHP, HTML, JS, CSS, SQL, C, and C++ outside of school. My favorite programming language would have to be JavaScript because I like how dynamic the libraries are. My interests would include playing MMORPGS, watching animes, reading, swimming, skiing, and mountain biking. This is a compilation of all of my work from AP CSP.
